  <p>This page uses <code>window.onload = init;</code> in the JS code  to execute the init function ONLY WHEN THE PAGE HAS BEEN LOADED!</p>
  
  <p>This is important as very often we cannot do important things before the DOM is ready (all HTML elements have been created and can be manipulated from JavaScript).</p>
  
  <p>PAGE STATUS: <span id="pageStatus">NOT LOADED YET</span></p>
